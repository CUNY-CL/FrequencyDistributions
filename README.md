This directory contains various linguistic frequency distributions, represented
by two-column TSV files where the first column is the linguistic representation
(usually, though not always, a token or word) and the second its frequency.

The [LNRE calculator](https://gist.github.com/kylebgorman/445f0143f43c1751f824af7140c1df04)
can ingest these files and produce useful descriptive statistics.
